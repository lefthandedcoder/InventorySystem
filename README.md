# InventorySystem
Software I Java Project
This project was a test of my ability to use a UML, GUI mock-up and a couple of webinars to build my own inventory management system. Competencies for this project were as follows:

Classes and Interfaces
Design software solutions with appropriate classes, objects, methods, and interfaces to achieve specific goals.

Object-Oriented Principles
Implement object-oriented design principles (e.g., inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction) in developing applications for ensuring the applicationâ€™s scalability.

Application Development
Produce application using Java programming language constructs to meet business requirements.

Exception Handling
Incorporate simple exception handling in application development for improving user experience and application stability.

User Interface Development
Develop user interfaces to meet project requirements.

My favorite feature about this project was the addition of the filtered list and sorted list
for dynamic searches where you can type in the part name or ID and search results are filtered 
regardless of whether the part name should be uppercase or lowercase. A future feature idea for
this project would be to include a select all or delete all feature for when the number of parts 
or products in this system gets to be too large or if a company providing certain parts no longer 
provides those certain parts. This would enable batch processing.
